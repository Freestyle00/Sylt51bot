# Sylt51bot
Sylt51bot is a small bot, made originally just for the [Sylt51 discord server](https://discord.gg/Sylt51 "Sylt51 discord invite") with .NET Core 3.1.

It implements a discord version of r/ich_iel's "KÃ¤nguru_Rechenknecht" and also has a fairly modular levelling system.

The bot uses the [DSharpPlus and DSharpPlus.CommandsNext](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus "GitHub D#+") libraries for interaction with the Discord API.
